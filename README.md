# 🎥 Dev Demo Platform

A web platform where programming students can showcase their projects through demo videos.
The goal is to make it easier to show how projects actually work, not just the source code.

This project is built as a social, portfolio-focused platform for students and junior developers.

# 🚀 Purpose

Help students present their projects in a clear and visual way

Make demos more accessible than just linking a GitHub repository

Provide a simple, social environment for feedback and interaction
